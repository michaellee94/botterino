# put the title in quotes (either single or double).
# If the title itself contains quotes , use the opposite style of quotes.
# If an apostrophe is used in your title, it is counted as a single quote


# post a round and reply to all comments
# must specify answer and tolerance

# post a round and check text (case insensitive)
  # use the 'text' field to check text and add 'similarity'
  # similarity ranges from 0.0 - 1.0
  # a similarity of 1.0 will only correct exact matches
  # this is not a good method to check for short strings
  # be careful when using this. don't get banned.
# (can also check text and coordinates on the same round)

    In this series I will be doing a music video round for 100 lanuages in order of total number of speakers


    [here](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/the-100-most-spoken-languages.jpg) is the full list
    I will be using.

    Maksing only indicates the language and not necessarily the location

  title: 'this is a title'
  answer: 23.234,123.2312325
  tolerance: 29.0

  after: 'Full SP: [insert SP here]'

# check multiple coordinates
# instead of specifying 'answer' and 'tolerance'
#   you must now specify 'answers' and 'tolerances'
#   each coordinate in 'answers' must be in quotes
#   you must have as many tolerances as you have answers
# coords in guess can be in any order
# coords MUST be in decimal format
# # can be combined with the other options like manual or after
Example:
  title: give me 3 coordinates within 20m, 60m, 40m respectively in google maps decimal format
  answers: ['55.1894288,30.19891', '5.3539059,-1.3835478', '69.511346, 103.513381']
  tolerances: [20, 60, 40]

# add multiple rounds in rounds.yaml
# to do this, just put two rounds right next to each other like this:
round_1:
  title: 'foo'
  answer: 12.34, 56.78
  tolerance: 42.0
  url: google.com
round_2:
  title: 'foo2'
  answer: 12.34, 56.78
  tolerance: 52.0
  url: bing.com

# remember to save the file rounds.yaml

# rounds.yaml can be edited to add new rounds while the bot is running
# when rounds are loaded, they are removed from rounds.yaml saved to a file called archive.yaml

# Automatically number rounds of a series
# Rules explained below
Series:
  title: Coordinates of this bridge?
  series: Trains on Bridges
  answer: 42.4343543,45.434543
  tolerance: 32

# Botterino will search through titles of your most recent 100 pg rounds for the string given in `series`
# titles must match the following format: [<series> #N] or [<series> #N/N] (tolerant of whitespce, # optional, no brackets optional)
# if a match is found, the series number will be incremented
# in the above example, if a previous round was named:
# a. [Round <Round Number>] Trains on Bridges #19 Coordinates of this bridge?
# b. [Round <Round Number>] [Trains on Bridges #19/350] Coordinates of this bridge?
# c. <There was no match found>
# the resulting title becomes:
#  a. [Round <Round Number>] [Trains on Bridges #20] Coordinates of this bridge?
#  b. [Round <Round Number>] [Trains on Bridges #20/350] Coordinates of this bridge?
#  c. [Round <Round Number>] [Trains on Bridges #1]
# if no match is found this round will be labeled as the first round in the series
